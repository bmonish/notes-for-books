Good evening to one and all! 
I extend my warm welcome to my faculties, principal, viceprincipals and my dearest alumni.
"No matter how much you hate college, you will miss it when you leave."
I hope this everyone would have heard this quote atleast once in their college life.
But college friendship also turn out to be the best time of our life and the friends we get in college become our bestest.
Amidst the hustle and bustle of the modern world taking time out of our lives to connect with our friends is becoming a tedious task.
But alumni meetings like this bring you one step closer to the process and takes you backward in time to the golden days.

I hope everyone, by at the end of the session will have relived the golden days with lots of laughter, joy and surprises and if possible happy tears.
